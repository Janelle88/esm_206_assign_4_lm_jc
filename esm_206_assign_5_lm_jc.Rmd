### Introduction


The pacific giant salamanders (*dicamptodon tenebrosus*) are a native species and the largest amphibians known in Oregon. Observing these species can give a clear signal on whether their water habitat is healthy as they are sensitive to water quality and are the first animals to react to negative impacts on their aquatic environment.

Since 1987 to present day, the Andrews Forest Long Term Ecological Research (Andrews Forest LTER) has been observing pacific giant salamanders as part of an aquatic vertebrate population study. The overall purpose of the study has been to observe the impacts of land use on the aquatic vertebrates. The research team conducted their work in Mack Creek located in the Andrews Experimental Forest in Oregon. The research team has been focusing on two specific areas of the creek; an upstream 500 year old coniferous forest and a clearcut forest.

Andrews Forest Long Term Ecological Reasearch has been using 2-pass electrofishing to capture specimen from the two regions of Mack Creek and measure and weigh each one for their records.

### Data and Methods

Data for this project was collected from 1987 to present day by the Andrews Forest Long Term Ecological Research team. Salamander counts, measurements, and weights were annually collected at two 150 meter sections (clear cut and old growth) of Mack Creek. The two 150 meter sections were partinioned off in three 50 meter reaches by nets. Each 50 meter reach was then sampled with 2-pass electrofishing. Salamander trends in clear cut areas of Mack Creek were compared with salamander trends in old growth areas of Mack Creek. All data was analyzed and put into figures through the software R version 3.6.1.

### Results

##### 1. Observed annual salamander counts in old growth and clear cut sections of Mack Creek

In the two creek areas, annual salamander counts followed a similar trend. However, there is no significant difference in salamander counts between the two sections of Mack Creek observed from 1993 to 2017.

```{r}

channel_class_df <- salamander_df %>% 
  filter(section %in% c("CC", "OG")) %>% 
# Filter data for only Clear Cut and Old Growth.

channel_class_table_props <- channel_class_table %>%
# Pivot wider to make a contingency table, long format bad for this
  adorn_percentages(denominator = "row") %>% 
# Denominator = row to get pct on row.
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 1) %>%

                      "Clear Cut", 
                      "Old Growth")) %>% 
# Column names - can't change row names in kable.
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped",
                full_width = F,
                position = "center") %>%

  add_header_above(bold = TRUE,
                   line = TRUE, 
                   c("Salamanders Observed in Mack Creek" = 3))
# Header number has to match number of columns.

```


```{r}
# ------------
# Results C
# chi-squared
# ------------

# Using the 2017 counts found in Results B above, answer: is there a significant difference in where in the channel Pacific giant salamanders are located (pool, cascade or side channel) between the two sections (old growth and clear cut)?

# Is there an association between where PGS live in the channel and what type of forest it is?

# H0: There is no association in where in the channel PGS are located b/w the two sections (CC vs. OG)
# HA: There is an association in where in the channel PGS are located b/w the two sections (CC vs. OG)
# Chi-squared test 

channel_class_table_chi <- channel_class_table %>% 
  select(-creek_area)
# Create data for chi sq. test.

channel_class_chi <- chisq.test(channel_class_table_chi)
# Create chi sq. test.

p_val_chi <- ifelse(channel_class_chi$p.value < .001, "< 0.001" , channel_class_chi$p.value)

# Use ifelse to show p values lower than .001.

```

Based on these results, there is no observed association between where salamanders are found depending on whether or not they are in a clear cut or old growth section of Mack Creek (p = `r round(p_val_chi, 2)`).

```

For salamanders observed in the two types of forest in Mack Creek (n = `r sample_og_cc`), for old growth sections the mean weight of salamanders is `r round(mean_og, 2)` $\pm$ `r round(sd_og, 2)` and for clear cut sections the mean weight of salamanders is `r round(mean_cc, 2)` $\pm$ `r round(sd_cc, 2)` with an actual difference in mean size between the two years being `r round(mean_og - mean_cc, 2)` (two-sided t-test, t(`r round(og_cc_ttest$parameter, 2)`) = `r round(og_cc_ttest$statistic, 2)`, p = `r round(og_cc_ttest$p.value, 2)`) with an effect size of `r round(og_cc_cd$estimate, 2)`. This indicates that there is no significant difference in weights of Salamanders observed between the two types of forest.

In Mack Creek (n = `r sample_og_cc`), the mean weight for salamanders found in cascades was `r round(mean_c, 2)` $\pm$ `r round(sd_c, 2)`, in pools the mean weight of salamanders was `r round(mean_p, 2)` $\pm$ `r round(sd_p, 2)`, and for side-channels the mean weight of salamanders was `r round(mean_sc, 2)` $\pm$ `r round(sd_sc, 2)` (one-way ANOVA, `r salamander_aov_summary[2]`) = `r round(salamander_aov_summary[7], 2)`, p-value = `r round(salamander_aov_summary[9], 3)`).
Using Tukey’s HSD, the post hoc pairwise testing shows that the mean weights of salamanders in pools differ significantly from salamanders in side-channels(p-value = `r round(salamander_post_hoc$creek_area[12], 3)`). The significant difference in mean weight between salamanders is only seen between salamanders in pools and side-channels. Despite the significant difference, the effect size is relatively small (`r round(cd_sc_p$estimate, 2)`).  Between salamanders in pools and cascades, there is no observed significant difference in means (p-value = `r round(salamander_post_hoc$creek_area[10], 3)`). Similarly, there is no observed significant difference for salamanders in side-channels and in cascades: (p-value = `r round(salamander_post_hoc$creek_area[11], 3)`).


#### Summary

- There is no significant difference in salamander counts between the two overall sections of Mack Creek (old growth and clear cut) from 1993 to 2017 (Figure 3).
- There is no association between salamander counts and the two sections of Mack Creek and their three sub-region areas (cascade, pool, and side-channel) in 2017 (Figure 4).
- There is no association and not a significant difference in salamander weights overall in old growth and clear cut areas of Mack Creek in 2017 (Figure 5).
- There is an association between salamander weight and the specific areas of the two sections of Mack Creek. There is a significant difference in salamander weight in cascade, pool, and side-channel areas between old growth and clear cut sections in 2017 (Figure 6).
