### Data and Methods

### Results

##### 1. Observed annual salamander counts in old growth and clear cut sections of Mack Creek

```{r}
# --------------------
# Create Graph A data
# --------------------

salamander_count <- salamander_df %>% 
# Call the data and assign it to an object.
# Pipe to move to the next step.
  group_by(section, year) %>% 
# Group receiving section and year by collapsing 
# multiple data points into a single row,
# based on what is summarized in the next step.
# Pipe to move to the next step.
  select(section, year, entity) %>% 
# Select specific columns to keep in the data frame.
  summarize("total" = sum(entity)) %>% 
# Summarize (new column = whatever you're doing(metric)).
    mutate("section_name" = ifelse(section == "OG", "old growth",
                              ifelse(section == "CC", "clear cut")))
# Create a new column containing non-abbreviated section names.
  
```

```{r, fig.cap="Figure 3: Annual salamander counts observed from 1993 - 2017 in two sections of Mack Creek that were either old growth (dark green) or clear cut (golden yellow) in the Andrews Experimental Forest. Data: Andrews Forest LTER"}
# ---------------
# Create Graph A
# ---------------

ggplot(data = salamander_count, aes(x = year, y = total, group = section)) + 
# Create a graph and call out data to be used,
# including what the x and y variables are.
# To create individual lines by section, need group = section.
  geom_line(aes(color = section_name), size = 1.2) +
# Color lines by section and specify line size.
  labs(color = "Sections of Mack Creek",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Annual salamander counts") + 
# Use color to create the legend title and create 
# labels for the x and y axes and title.
  theme_light() +
# Call out a theme to tweak the display of an existing theme.

          method = list(dl.combine("last.points"), 
                        cex = .8)) +

# method needs to be written like this.
  theme(legend.position = c(0.19, 0.837)) + 
# Manually reposition legend.
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0),

  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0),
                     limits = c(0, 550)) +
# Needed to expand limits for section counts.
  scale_color_manual(breaks = c("old growth", "clear cut"), values = c("sandybrown", "darkslategray")) 
# Manually change line colors in graph based on 
# whether a section is old growth or clear cut.

```

#### B

Table of 2017 salamander counts by channel classification (pool, cascades and side-channel) in old growth (OG) and clear cut (CC) sections of Mack Creek.

```{r}

```

#### C

Using the 2017 counts found in Results B above, answer: is there a significant difference in where in the channel Pacific giant salamanders are located (pool, cascade or side channel) between the two sections (old growth and clear cut)?

```{r}

```

#### D

Compare weights of Pacific giant salamanders in clear cut and old growth forest sections of the creek in 2017.

To do:
- Histogram
- qqplot

```{r}

```

#### E

Compare weights of Pacific giant salamanders in pools, cascades and side-channels of Mack Creek in 2017.

To do:
- Exclude from final data, but visually explore
  - Histogram
  - qqplot

```{r}

```
