### Introduction


The pacific giant salamanders (*dicamptodon tenebrosus*) are a native species and the largest amphibians known in Oregon. Observing these species can give a clear signal on whether their water habitat is healthy as they are sensitive to water quality and are the first animals to react to negative impacts on their aquatic environment.

Since 1987 to present day, the Andrews Forest Long Term Ecological Research (Andrews Forest LTER) has been observing pacific giant salamanders as part of an aquatic vertebrate population study. The research team conducted their work in Mack Creek located in the Andrews Experimental Forest in Oregon. The research team has been focusing on two specific areas of the creek; an upstream 500 year old coniferous forest and a clearcut forest.

### Data and Methods

### Results

##### 1. Observed annual salamander counts in old growth and clear cut sections of Mack Creek

In the two creek areas, annual salamander counts followed a similar trend.

```{r}
# --------------------
# Create Graph A data
# --------------------

salamander_count <- salamander_df %>% 
# Call the data and assign it to an object.
# Pipe to move to the next step.
  group_by(section, year) %>% 
# Group receiving section and year by collapsing 
# multiple data points into a single row,
# based on what is summarized in the next step.
# Pipe to move to the next step.
  select(section, year, entity) %>% 
# Select specific columns to keep in the data frame.
  summarize("total" = sum(entity)) %>% 
# Summarize (new column = whatever you're doing(metric)).
    mutate("section_name" = ifelse(section == "OG", "old growth",
                              ifelse(section == "CC", "clear cut")))
# Create a new column containing non-abbreviated section names.
  
```

```{r, fig.cap="Figure 3: Annual salamander counts observed from 1993 - 2017 in two sections of Mack Creek that were either old growth (dark green) or clear cut (light green) in the Andrews Experimental Forest. Data: Andrews Forest LTER"}

# whether a section is old growth or clear cut.

```

##### 2. Table of 2017 salamander counts by channel classification (pool, cascades and side-channel) in old growth (OG) and clear cut (CC) sections of Mack Creek.

```{r, fig.cap="Figure 4: ... Data: Andrews Forest LTER"}
channel_class_df <- salamander_df %>% 
  filter(section %in% c("CC", "OG")) %>% 
  #filter data for only Clear Cut and Old Growth
  filter(unittype %in% c("C", "SC", "P")) %>%
  #filter for only pools, side channels and channel
  mutate("creek_area" = ifelse(unittype == "C", "Cascade",
                        ifelse(unittype == "SC", "Side-Channel", "Pool"))) %>%
  # make names nicer for table
  count(section, creek_area)
# count the data for salamanders in these variables

channel_class_table <- channel_class_df %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = section,
              values_from = n) 

channel_class_table_props <- channel_class_table %>%
  #pivot wider to make a contingency table, long format bad for this
  adorn_percentages(denominator = "row") %>% 
  # denominator = row to get pct on row
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 1) %>% 
  # rounding the decimal places
  adorn_ns(position = "front")
# numbers in front of percentages

channel_class_table_props %>% 
  kable(col.names = c("Area of Creek",
                      "Clear Cut", 
                      "Old Growth")) %>% 
  #column names - can't change row names in kable
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped",
                full_width = F,
                position = "center") %>% 
  # full width (F), centered table
  add_header_above(bold = TRUE,
                   line = TRUE, 
                   c("Salamanders Observed in Mack Creek" = 3))
# header number has to match number of columns
```

Using the 2017 counts found in Results B above, answer: is there a significant difference in where in the channel Pacific giant salamanders are located (pool, cascade or side channel) between the two sections (old growth and clear cut)?
